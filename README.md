# Breakout

You know that retro game. You have to know dude. If you don't bless you
young man.

## About this project
The goal for this project is for me to mess around with using SDL with C.
The code is poorly written and very spaghetti. I don't really care about
the code design for this project as I just want to quickly get things done and
see how to implement it. Of course for the future project it would be better
written.

## Build
**Requirements**
- SDL3
- C compiler
- make

> [!NOTE]
> Adjust the rpath in Makefile accordingly

```
make && ./breakout
#or
make run
```
